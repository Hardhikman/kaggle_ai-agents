Here are some of the **key new developments and trends**:\n\n**1. AI-Powered Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **Uncovering Novel Targets:** AI algorithms can sift through massive amounts of biological data (genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, electronic health records) to identify previously unknown or underappreciated biological targets (like specific proteins or genes) that play a crucial role in diseases.\n*   **Predicting Target Druggability:** Beyond just identifying targets, AI can predict how likely it is that a particular target can be modulated by a drug, saving researchers time and resources by focusing on the most promising candidates.\n*   **Network Biology Insights:** AI helps researchers understand complex biological networks and how disruptions in these networks lead to disease. This allows for the identification of more effective intervention points.\n\n**2. Accelerating Molecule Design and Optimization:**\n\n*   **Generative AI for Novel Molecules:** This is a huge area. Generative AI models (like GANs and VAEs) are being trained on vast libraries of existing molecules to design entirely new chemical compounds with desired properties, such as high binding affinity to a target and favorable pharmacokinetic profiles.\n*   **De Novo Drug Design:** Instead of screening existing libraries, AI can design molecules from scratch, exploring vast chemical spaces that humans might not conceive of.\n*   **Property Prediction:** AI can accurately predict various properties of a designed molecule, including its efficacy, toxicity, solubility, and how it will be absorbed and metabolized by the body, allowing for rapid iteration and optimization.\n*   **Synthesizability Assessment:** Some AI tools are now incorporating the ability to predict how easily a designed molecule can be synthesized in the lab, a critical practical consideration.\n\n**3. Enhancing Preclinical Testing and Clinical Trial Design:**\n\n*   **Predicting Drug Efficacy and Toxicity:** AI can analyze data from cell cultures and animal models to predict how a drug might perform in humans, potentially reducing the need for extensive and costly animal testing.\n*   **Virtual Screening at Scale:** AI can rapidly screen millions or even billions of potential compounds against a target in silico, identifying promising candidates for further experimental validation.\n*   **Biomarker Discovery for Patient Stratification:** AI helps identify biomarkers that can predict which patients are most likely to respond to a particular drug. This is crucial for precision medicine and for designing more efficient clinical trials by enrolling the right patient populations.\n*   **Optimizing Clinical Trial Protocols:** AI can analyze historical trial data to optimize trial design, predict potential bottlenecks, and improve patient recruitment strategies.\n\n**4. Revolutionizing Small Molecule and Biologics Discovery:**\n\n*   **Small Molecules:** AI is excelling at designing novel small molecules with specific therapeutic effects.\n*   **Biologics (e.g., Antibodies, Peptides):** AI is also making strides in designing and optimizing biologics, including predicting antibody-antigen binding, designing therapeutic proteins, and even aiding in the development of novel vaccines.\n\n**Examples of companies and research pushing boundaries:**\n\n*   **Insilico Medicine:** Known for using generative AI to design novel molecules and take them through preclinical stages rapidly.\n*   **Exscientia:** Focuses on using AI to automate drug discovery and design, aiming to deliver drug candidates in significantly shorter timeframes.\n*   **Recursion Pharmaceuticals:** Leverages AI and automation to map cellular functions and identify potential drug candidates by analyzing massive image datasets of cellular phenotypes.\n*   **Atomwise:** Uses deep learning for small molecule drug discovery, screening vast libraries for potential drug candidates.\n*   **NVIDIA:** Their \"Clara\" platform and GPU acceleration are crucial for powering many of these AI drug discovery efforts.\n\n**Challenges and Future Directions:**\n\n*   **Data Quality and Availability:** The effectiveness of AI is heavily dependent on the quality and quantity of data.\n*   **Interpretability of AI Models:** Understanding *why* an AI model predicts a certain molecule will be effective or toxic is crucial for trust and further development.\n*   **Translational Challenges:** Bridging the gap between AI predictions and successful clinical outcomes remains a key hurdle.\n*   **Regulatory Scrutiny:** As AI-driven drugs move through the pipeline, regulatory bodies are adapting to evaluate these novel approaches.\n\nIn summary, AI is not just tweaking drug discovery; it's fundamentally reshaping it, making the process faster, more efficient, and more likely to yield successful new therapies.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're likely referring to the second major area I highlighted: **Accelerating Molecule Design and Optimization**. This is a particularly exciting frontier in AI-driven drug discovery.\n\nLet me elaborate on what this entails and why it's so significant:\n\n**The Core Idea: AI as a Creative Chemist and Predictor**\n\nTraditionally, drug discovery involved:\n1.  **Target Identification:** Finding a biological target (like a protein) involved in a disease.\n2.  **High-Throughput Screening (HTS):** Testing millions of existing chemical compounds against that target to see if any bind and have an effect.\n3.  **Lead Optimization:** Taking the \"hits\" from HTS and modifying them to improve their efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic properties (how the body absorbs, distributes, metabolizes, and excretes the drug). This is often a slow, iterative process involving a lot of trial and error.\n\nAI is revolutionizing this by doing two main things:\n\n**1. Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design (De Novo Design):**\n\n*   **What it is:** Instead of just screening existing libraries, generative AI models can be trained on vast datasets of known molecules and their properties. They then learn the underlying \"rules\" of chemistry and molecular structure. Based on this learning, they can *generate entirely new molecular structures* that have never been seen before but are predicted to have desired characteristics.\n*   **How it works (simplified):**\n    *   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** These involve two neural networks working against each other. One network (the generator) tries to create realistic molecules, and the other (the discriminator) tries to distinguish between real molecules and the generated ones. Through this competition, the generator gets better and better at producing plausible, novel molecules.\n    *   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** These models learn to encode molecules into a lower-dimensional \"latent space\" and then decode them back into molecular structures. By manipulating points in this latent space, researchers can generate new molecules with interpolated or extrapolated properties.\n    *   **Reinforcement Learning:** This can be combined with generative models to guide the molecule generation process towards specific goals, such as maximizing binding affinity to a target or minimizing predicted toxicity.\n*   **Why it's powerful:**\n    *   **Explores Vast Chemical Space:** The number of potential molecules is astronomically large. AI can explore this space much more broadly and efficiently than humans or traditional screening methods.\n    *   **Designs for Specific Properties:** AI can be trained to generate molecules with specific desired properties from the outset, such as high potency, good solubility, or low predicted side effects.\n    *   **Overcomes Limitations of Existing Libraries:** Existing compound libraries are finite and may not contain optimal candidates. AI can create entirely new ones.\n\n**2. AI for Property Prediction and Optimization:**\n\n*   **What it is:** Once a potential molecule is designed (either by AI or traditionally), AI models can rapidly predict a wide range of its properties. This is crucial for filtering promising candidates and for guiding modifications.\n*   **Key Properties Predicted:**\n    *   **Binding Affinity:** How strongly the molecule will bind to its intended biological target.\n    *   **Pharmacokinetics (ADME):** Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion – how the drug will behave in the body.\n    *   **Toxicity:** Potential harmful side effects.\n    *   **Solubility and Stability:** How well it dissolves and how long it remains stable.\n    *   **Synthesizability:** How likely it is that the molecule can be actually made in a laboratory using existing chemical techniques.\n*   **Why it's powerful:**\n    *   **Rapid Iteration:** Instead of waiting weeks or months for experimental results, researchers can get AI-driven predictions in minutes or hours. This allows for much faster design-test-optimize cycles.\n    *   **Reduces Experimental Costs:** By accurately predicting undesirable properties early on, AI helps weed out problematic molecules before costly and time-consuming lab experiments are performed.\n    *   **Informs Optimization:** If a generated molecule has a good binding affinity but poor solubility, AI can suggest specific chemical modifications that might improve solubility while maintaining or improving binding.\n\n**The Impact:**\n\nThis combination of generative design and predictive power allows researchers to:\n\n*   **Discover novel drug candidates much faster.**\n*   **Develop drugs with better efficacy and safety profiles.**\n*   **Explore new therapeutic areas and targets that were previously intractable.**\n*   **Significantly reduce the time and cost associated with early-stage drug discovery.**\n\nCompanies are already seeing promising results, with AI-designed molecules entering preclinical and even clinical trials. This development is fundamentally changing how we approach the creation of new medicines.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The landscape of companies leveraging AI for molecule design and optimization in drug discovery is rapidly growing and includes a mix of dedicated AI biotech firms, established pharmaceutical giants investing in AI capabilities, and technology providers.\n\nHere are some of the **main players and categories of companies** involved:\n\n**1.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
